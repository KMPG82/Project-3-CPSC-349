    For this project, we used a stock photo collection provided by <b>Pexels</b>
    to build a website that displayed each photo of the collection as a thumbnail.
    The thumbnails are also clickable and would take the user to a page for that
    specific photo, which displayed a larger picture and the photographers info.
    However, instead of hard coding an HTML page for each photo we used <b>Eleventy</b>,
    a static site generator. Utilizing a static site generator allowed us to generate
    an HTML page for each photo using a template. The navigation bar and footer are also
    within their own template that is used on every HTML file in this project. We also 
    used the MVP stylesheet for styling HTML elements so we could focus on learning how
    to use Eleventy. From this, we learned the how static site generators can be used 
    and how convenient they can be for building a static website.
