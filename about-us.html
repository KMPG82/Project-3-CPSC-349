    For this project, we used a stock photo collection provided by <b>Pexels</b>
    to build a website that displayed each photo of the collection as a thumbnail.
    The thumbnails are also clickable and would take the user to a page for that
    specific photo, which displayed a larger picture and the photographers info.
    However, instead of hard coding an HTML page for each photo we used <b>Eleventy</b>,
    a static site generator. Utilizing a static site generator allowed us to generate
    an HTML page for each photo using a template. The navigation bar and footer are also
    within their own template that is used on every HTML file in this project. From this,
    we learned the how static site generators can be used and how convenient they can be
    for building a static website.
